<!-- basic description -->
Hyloblog is a static site generator. The name derives from ὕλη, the Greek word
for _matter_.

<!-- how it works -->
Hyloblog generates blog sites (like [this one][blog]) from Markdown files in
Git repos using simple default rules to limit metadata in source files, such as

- The highest-level title in an `*.md` source file is treated as the title of
  the corresponding blog post

- The date and author of the commit when an `*.md` file is first added are
  the date and author of the post

- The path to a given file within the repo is mirrored exactly in the generated
  files, so if you want an `/updates` section in your blog you simply make a
  directory and start writing updates.

<!-- influences -->
Although Hyloblog learns from static-site generators like Jekyll and Hugo, an
important influence is LaTeX.
We want to emphasise the same form/content separation in blogging and site
building that LaTeX accomplishes in typesetting.

## Building

Copy the files in [configs](https://github.com/hyloblog/hyloblog/tree/chore/readme-update/configs)
into the root directory and modify them as appropriate.

Some of the targets require sudo on Ubuntu, which is supplied in the
following way:

```bash
make up SUDO=sudo
```

To build statically: 

```bash
make up SUDO=sudo BUILDARGS=--static
```
