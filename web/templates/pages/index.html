		We're building <a href="https://xr0.dev">Xr0</a> and enjoy
		writing about it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Substack offers great interactivity, but isn't built for
		technical writing. It has poor support for code: no syntax
		highlighting and the inline code rendering is
			<span class="substack-code">jarring</span>.
		Plus, we want to manage our blog posts as text files with Git.
	</p>

	<p>
		Existing static-site generators like Jekyll and Hugo are
		powerful but seem to prioritise customisability over writing.
		Names like
			<em>assets</em>,
			<em>layouts</em>,
			<em>data</em>,
			<em>includes</em> etc.
		dominate project folders instead of your actual writing.
		There's nothing wrong with this; we just want something
		simpler, so we built Hyloblog.
